- `node-expansion/` - Node coverage expansion plans
- `technical-docs/` - Technical architecture documentation
- `planning-docs/` - Complex planning and analysis documents

## Rationale

The n8n-lint tool is designed to be a simple CLI for validating n8n workflows. These features were archived to:

1. **Maintain Simplicity** - Keep the tool focused on core validation
2. **Reduce Complexity** - Avoid over-engineering for a simple tool
3. **Improve Usability** - Make it easy for developers to understand and use
4. **Future Flexibility** - Keep advanced features available for future consideration

## Current Focus

The tool now focuses on:

- Core workflow validation
- Essential CLI commands (validate, import-schema, list-schemas)
- Simple JSON output for automation
- Developer-focused documentation
